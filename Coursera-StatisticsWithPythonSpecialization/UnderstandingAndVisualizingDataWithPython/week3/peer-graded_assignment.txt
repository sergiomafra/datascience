FROM: Fictional Anonymous
Date: March 31, 2020
SUBJECT:  Marketing based on Statistical Analysis

Bellaggio's Pasta has an enormous base of clients that are preoccupied with health habits and they advocate in pro of Bellagio's because of its capacity to produce integral mass, light cheese and its variety of vegetarian toppings options. This concern about healthier food is not a privilege of Bellaggio's clients itself. Your main competitor Industry of Pizza is losing clients that claim that their pizza is too greasy, despite the amazing taste.

It's time to convert Industry's doubtful clients to your company. The way proposed is to collect data about the amounts of each product used to cook every health and greasy pizza and its nutrition data. With these data in hand, the statistical team can produce a side-by-side bar to compare each healthy pizza with its Industry-greasy version.

This way, clients that are not satisfied with Industry's dark side pizzas can come to the healthy side. Bellaggio' s!
