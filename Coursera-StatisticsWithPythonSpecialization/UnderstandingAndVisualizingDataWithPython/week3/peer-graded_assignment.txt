SUBJECT:  Marketing based on Statistical Analysis

Bellaggio's Pasta has an enormous base of clients that are preoccupied with health habits and they advocate in pro of Bellagio's because of its capacity to produce integral mass, light cheese and its variety of vegetarian toppings options. This concern about healthier food is not a privilege of Bellaggio's clients itself. Your main competitor Industry of Pizza is losing clients that claim that their pizza is too greasy, despite the amazing taste.

It's time to convert Industry's doubtful clients to your company. The way proposed is to compare the healthiness of Bellagio's pizzas with the correspondent one of Industry of pizzas because Bellagio's is healthier than Industry of Pizza and this is our claim. The marketing team could use a side-by-side bar chart comparing each of the ingredients most commonly used in pizzas and its nutritional values. An example would be a comparison between the cheese or the tomato sauce of each company showing how many calories, protein, preservatives presence, nutritive ingredients and so on. These data can be easily collected from each product package.

The next step is to measure the return of the propaganda. Are the number of clients and the number of healthier pizza orders increasing? This data can be collected directly from your database selecting all tables of the day and all orders. For each day of the week, a table with the total number of clients and the total orders of healthier pizza should be displayed in a column along with the same data about the past 3 weeks of the same day. It will give a glance at what is going on. If the numbers are increasing, it is indicative that the propaganda is working. Further, analyzes should be conducted to guarantee that this is the case.
